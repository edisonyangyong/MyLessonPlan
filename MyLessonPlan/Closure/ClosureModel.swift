    var popupContentOnWhat = ["The Closure is a short 3 – 5 minute activity to prepare each student for the Summative Assessment or to end the lesson on a positive note. The students do the intellectual work.","The purpose of the closure is to bring the lesson to a close. This is different than the Summative Assessment. The closure should be a short, 3 – 5-minute learning activity that is participative, intellectual, and creative. This means the closure is not just a game. This means that ALL students must do intellectual work. Saying, “Ok class, can anyone tell us what we learned today,” is NOT and effective closure. Saying, “Ok, does anyone have any questions,” is NOT an effective closure. Saying, “Ok, let’s summarize what we learned today,” is NOT an effective closure. How will you as the teacher know that ALL students are intellectually involved? Some students will not answer your questions. Some students are not able to answer because they didn’t learn, or they are thinking about who they are meeting with after class. What SHORT, CREATIVE, ENGAGING activity could you do to involve ALL of your students intellectually? How can you get all the students thinking about the topic? Remember, that just because your students are quiet doesn’t mean they are ready to learn. Just because students are looking at the teacher doesn’t mean they are intellectually paying attention to the topic. So, what can you do as the teacher to facilitate ALL the students participating? The answer to this question will require thought and creativity on your part. Often having students write something, draw something, put pencil to paper are the best types of Anticipatory Sets / Closures. As with the Anticipatory Set, the Closure is not necessarily for singing, dancing, and theatrical performances; just a solid, thoughtful, participative learning activity. The closure is the glue that glues the lesson together. It is a good idea to write the Closure using a lot of details - all the instructions, the questions you plan to ask, all the directions you plan to give, and all the responses you anticipate your students may give. Writing out this level of detail will require you to clarify in your own mind what you are saying and doing, and give you the chance to practice and visualize yourself teaching. Refer to \"Inspire Me button\" for ideas about Closures, Anticipatory Sets, and Learning Activities for ideas."]
