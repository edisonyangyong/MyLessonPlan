The following questions are generic that would fit any lesson, but you should write them with this specific lesson in mind. That will require you to personal these questions to this particular lesson content and instructional model. Ask yourself questions:\n•    Before the lesson (while planning) such as, what verbs really describe the learning I desire for my students? What learning activities will be meaningful? How will I include all my students? What are potential problem areas in the content?\n•    During the lesson (while teaching) such as, am I speaking clearly? Am I using appropriate vocabulary? Am I giving clear instructions? Are students learning?\n•    After the lesson (while reflecting) such as, did the Summative Assessment really measure my learning objectives? What problems did my students have with this content?"]
