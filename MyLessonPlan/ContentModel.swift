        "Content Standards differ depending on the institution. For example, the Content Standards for the public school system in Hawaii are found in the Hawaii Common Core Standards at the Hawaii Department of Education. These are the overarching learning goals the state thinks your students should learn in school. The Common Core standards cover English and Math for all grade levels. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) cover the standards specific to Science. The WIDA Content Standards is a great resource for teaching English Language Learners. You can follow the links to find the Content Standards for other content subjects. Of course each state and Country has their own Content Standards. You can find those standards online. If you are using this Lesson Plan Creator App to create a lesson plan for a university course, or Church lesson, or any other type of teaching situation, we recommend you include identifying information for the content you teach, such as book chapters, page numbers, topic headings, and even scripture information."]
