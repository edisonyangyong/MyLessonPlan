This assessment is usually given at the end of your instructional sequence in the form of a quiz, worksheet, project, something that provides evidence that the students learned the outcomes and how well they learned them. This Summative Assessment gives you evidence / data. Your Summative Assessment should have a rubric. The rubric is a scoring guide for you and your students. It explains what students need to do and how well they need to do it. The rubric should be provided to the students before the assessment or project is completed. For lessons that span more than one class period (or units), the Summative Assessment is typically given after the final lesson."]
