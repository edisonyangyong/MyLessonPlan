        "The purpose of the Anticipatory Set is to get your students ready to learn the content. The Anticipatory Set is a short part of your lesson, only 3 – 5 minutes to prepare your students intellectually for the lesson. Activate your students’ prior knowledge about the content. Focus your students’ attention toward the topic. The anticipatory set is not to teach actual content, but it is to get your students ready to learn. Saying, “Ok, class, today we are going to learn about multiplication,” is NOT an effective anticipatory set. Saying, “Can anyone tell me what they know about multiplication?” is NOT an effective anticipatory set. This is NOT engaging. Some students will not answer or are not able to answer. Some students will always answer and shout out answers. So, how will you know all the students are participating? What SHORT, CREATIVE, ENGAGING activity could you do to involve ALL of your students intellectually? How can you get all the students thinking about the topic? Remember, that just because your students are quiet doesn’t mean they are ready to learn. Just because students are looking at the teacher doesn’t mean they are intellectually paying attention to the topic. So, what can you do as the teacher to facilitate ALL the students participating? The answer to this question will require thought and creativity on your part. The anticipatory set is not necessarily for singing, dancing, and theatrical performances; just a solid, thoughtful, participative learning activity. It is a good idea to write the Anticipatory Set using a lot of details - all the instructions, the questions you plan to ask, all the directions you plan to give, and all the responses you anticipate your students may give. Writing out this level of detail will require you to clarify in your own mind what you are saying and doing, and give you the chance to practice and visualize yourself teaching. Refer to the \"Inspire Me button\" for ideas about Closures, Anticipatory Sets, and Learning Activities for ideas."
